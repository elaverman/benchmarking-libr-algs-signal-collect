Benchmarking Algorithms for Distributed Constraints Optimization in Signal/Collect
======================

This repository includes all code that was used to evaluate the various local iterative best-response algorithms presented in this thesis.

### Build

The evaluation program was developed for JVM 1.7 using Scala 2.10 (http://www.scala-lang.org/).

The program is to be built with SBT (http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as follows (assuming a typical UNIX shell).
After SBT has been installed and and the path of its binaries was added to the environment variable PATH, execute the following:

    $ sbt compile

After that, the files that are necessary for import into eclipse can be generated by executing:

    $ sbt eclipse

### Directory structure

Notable directories:

 - `results/`
 
   The raw data obtained from the benchmark.
 - `graphs/`
 
   The graphs on which the algorithms were run.
 - `Rscripts/`
 
   Scripts for the R programming language that were used for data analysis, the creation of graphs, and the plotting of images.
   
 - `lib/`
 
   Unmanaged libraries. This folder includes Signal/Collect version 2.
